# Building from source

In order to build from source, some dependencies are needed:

```
make
g++
llvm-18
cmake
bison
flex
doxygen
graphviz
```

In order to install these dependencies on an Ubuntu or Debian system, this should work:

```
apt-get install build-essential install bison flex cmake llvm
```
